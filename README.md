# 🌤️ Weather API App

A beginner-friendly frontend project that fetches real-time weather data using a public API. This project demonstrates my ability to build interactive interfaces using **JavaScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **RESTful APIs**—foundational skills I am building as I transition into the frontend development space.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Search by city to get current weather data
- 📡 Asynchronous API handling with `fetch`
- 🎨 Clean and responsive UI with **Tailwind CSS**
- 📱 Mobile-first design principles
- ✅ Git version control and structured codebase

---

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **OpenWeatherMap API (or similar)**
- **Git/GitHub**

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-api.git

# Navigate to the folder
cd weather-api

# Open index.html in your browser
```

## 📦 Project Structure

```
weather-api/
├── index.html        # Main HTML file
├── script.js         # API handling + DOM manipulation
├── style.css         # Tailwind CSS setup or custom styles
└── .gitignore
```

## 📚 What I Learned

- Consuming and handling APIs using `fetch()`
- Parsing JSON and updating the DOM dynamically
- Using utility-first CSS (Tailwind) for quick styling
- Managing files and versions with Git
- Writing clean, readable, and maintainable JavaScript

## 🧭 Goals

This is one of my first projects as I start building a portfolio to apply for **frontend development internships**. My focus is on:

- **Solidifying core JavaScript knowledge**
- **Becoming comfortable with asynchronous code**
- **Building aesthetically pleasing interfaces with Tailwind**
